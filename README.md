# Portfolio 2 - Course Assignment

As a developer, it is essential to maintain a level of professionalism that goes beyond writing code. Documentation plays a crucial role in enabling other developers to run our code without any issues. Additionally, a professional-looking portfolio instills confidence in our abilities and the work we do.

## Goal
As a developer, it is essential to maintain a level of professionalism that goes beyond writing code. Documentation plays a crucial role in enabling other developers to run our code without any issues. Additionally, a professional-looking portfolio instills confidence in our abilities and the work we do.

## Brief
In this assignment, you will document three prior submissions from the first year:

1. Semester Project 2
2. JavaScript Frameworks CA
3. Project Exam 2

You will create a README.md file at the root of each of these projects and document the submissions following a given format. Additionally, you will create a README.md file for your own personal GitHub profile. Finally, you will create a portfolio webpage that lists these three projects.

## Portfolio Webpage
The portfolio webpage should include the following:

- List the 3 projects as cards.
- Each card should contain:
  - The title of the project.
  - A description.
  - A screenshot showcasing the project when running.
  - A link to the GitHub repository.
  - If the project is online, a link to the live site.

To create your portfolio webpage, you can use the [Best-README-Template](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template) as a template.

Please refer to the individual project README.md files for detailed documentation and information.
